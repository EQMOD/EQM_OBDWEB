 * The interrupt intercept vectors in the boot code simply jump to the Applications's INTVEC's,
 * at the expected "OFFSET" from address zero, except for any interrupts that the boot code uses.
 * In which case, the boot code makes a quick check - if in boot loader mode, the IVEC is consumed,
 * otherwise it is forwarded to the Application.
